# Battleship-Game-Engine
This repository contains the code for a Human to play 3 different engines for Battleship. The engines are 
1. `Naive_Solver` - places ships randomly, attacks randomly and does not learn about ships positions
2. `Intermediate_Adversary` - places ships randomly, attacks randomly but remembers ships positions and increases attacks accordingly
3. `Boogeyman` - plays perfectly via the battleship playing algorithm


The **Battleship Playing Guide** details how you should interact with the text-based game to play it. The documentation for the various parts of the code are found within the markdown files in the respective folders and 
the comments in the code. A final PDF will be made detailing the algorithm implemented for Boogeyman and some aspects
of the code
(TO BE COMPLETED)
