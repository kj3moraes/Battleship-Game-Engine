# Battleship-Game-Engine
This is a text-based PvE game where the player can decide the engine that they would like to go up against. The choices are :
1. `Naive_Solver` - places ships randomly, attacks randomly and does not learn about ships positions
2. `Intermediate_Adversary` - places ships randomly, attacks randomly but remembers ships positions and increases attacks accordingly
3. `Boogeyman` - plays perfectly via the battleship playing algorithm. Shows no mercy


The **Battleship Playing Guide** details how you should interact with the text-based game interface to play it properly.
The documentation for the various parts of the code are found within the markdown files in the respective folders and 
the comments in the code. A final PDF will be made detailing the algorithm implemented for Boogeyman and some aspects
of the code.
