# Battleship-Game-Engine
This repository contains the code for a Human to play 3 different engines for Battleship. The engines are 
1. Naive-Solver - places ships randomly, attacks randomly and does not learn about ships positions
2. Intermediate-Adversary - places ships randomly, attacks randomly but remembers ships positions and increases attacks accoprdingly
3. Boogeyman - plays perfectly via the battleship playing algorithm

(TO BE COMPLETED)



## How to Play
This is a text-based game engine that is implemented in Java. The rules of the game are the same as the official 
version given by [Hasbro](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.pdf). For this game, the commands to play 
are as follows :

* Menu 1 
  * `start` - starts the **Human vs. Machine** match
  * `exit` - terminates the program
* Menu 2 (after `start`)
  * fk (TO BE COMPLETED)  
  
The documentation for the various parts of the code are found within the markdown files in the respective folders and 
the comments in the code. A final PDF will be made detailing the algorithm implemented for Boogeyman and some aspects
of the code
