# Battleship-Game-Engine
This repository contains the code for a Human to play 3 different engines for Battleship. The engines are 
1. Naive-Solver - places ships randomly, attacks randomly and does not learn about ships positions
2. Intermediate-Adversary - places ships randomly, attacks randomly but remembers ships positions and increases attacks accoprdingly
3. Boogeyman - plays perfectly via the battleship playing algorithm
