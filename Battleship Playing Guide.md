# Battleship Playing Guide
This is a PvE style Battleship game that allows the user to choose which Engine they want to go up against. The interface
is text-based, so you will need an IDE or code editor to run this in. 

---
## How-to-Play
This guide instructs the reader on how to use the Battleship text-based game engine. The rules of the game are the same as the official 
version given by [Hasbro](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.pdf). At the start of the program, you will need to 
give some details for the game to take place.

* Menu 1 _[ACTION MENU]_
  * `[s]tart` - starts the **Human vs. Machine** match
  * `e[x]it` - terminates the program
  
The user should type in the appropriate letter - `s` or `x` to perform the respective action.
Following the ACTION MENU, you will be prompted to type your name. This will be followed by 

* Menu 2 (after `start`) _[ENGINE SELECTION MENU]_
  * `[N]aive-Solver` - easy adversary
  * `[I]ntermediate-Adversary` - challenging but not invincible. (equivalent to another human)
  * `[B]oogeyman` - plays perfectly with no mercy
  
Type any one of the above letters (uppercase or lowercase is finem) to access that engine to play with. If any other letter is typed then the appropriate error message is displayed and the menu is shown again. 

### BATTLESHIP GAME
Once again this consists of two parts - Setup and Wartime. The Human will always go as Player 1. However, if the user
wants they are free to modify the source code in the `Battleship.java` file to switch up the Players or add a menu.
Player 2's actions are completely automated (obviously). 

### SETUP
During setup, Player 1 is prompted first to place his/her ships on the battlefield. When prompted to do so a picture of the current 
battlefield arrangement will be shown and the user must type the first coordinate on the first line and the second coordinate on the second line.
* The Row letter must be followed by the Column number with no gaps between them
* Type the first coordinates and **press enter** and then type the second coordinates.
  (Remember to calculate the position distance. The battlefield is printed to assist with this.)
* Only horizontal and vertical placements are legal

Remember to examine the length of the ship and the corresponding coordinates. _(You can't fit a Battleship (4 cells) in a space of 3 cells).
For example:

```
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A O O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~                  <---- YOUR BATTLEFIELD BEFORE PLACEMENT OF THE SHIP
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 


Enter the coordinates of the Battleship (4 cells): 
D9
G9

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A O O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~                  <---- YOUR BATTLEFIELD AFTER PLACEMENT OF THE SHIP
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 


Enter the coordinates of the Submarine (3 cells): 

```

#### VALID PLACEMENT
An valid placement of a ship is when it does not break any of the following conditions. An appropriate error message will be displayed if there is something wrong with the input. :
* The specified coordinates are too small or too large for the ship
* The specified coordinates do not fit on a line (either horizontally or vertically) 
* The coordinates are invalid (eg. letters > J or numbers outside the 1 to 10 range)
* The ships are touching each other (only touching diagonally is legal).
* The ships are crossing (i.e the coordinates of the placement overlap with the position of a pre-existing ship) 

Once Player 1 has completed setup, **double press the Enter key** and Player 2 (Engine) will automatically place its
ships. A message will be displayed indicating that Player 2 has completed the Setup and that War is about to begin

### WARTIME
For Wartime, Player 1 wil go first. Player 1 will be shown Player 2's "Fog of War" (FOW) screen at the top and 
they have to guess where they want to fire. Under P2's FOW is a divider and P1's own ship layout.    
**What is "Fog of War" ? It is state where only the HIT / MISS positions on a Battlefield can be displayed**   
P1 will guess where to fire and if they hit a ship they will see that part marked with the HIT character whether 
that be X or (any character that is designated by the programmer). 

This is then followed by an Enter prompt which generated as large amount of space and then Player 2 will play. 
The following example denotes a possible scenario (at the start of Wartime) :



```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~                  <---- P2's BATTLEFIELD (UNDER FOG OF WAR)
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

--------------------
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ O 
C ~ O O O O O ~ O ~ O 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~                  <---- P1'S BATTLEFIED VISIBLE ON P1's TURN
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

Player 1, it's your turn:
A2

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A ~ X ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~                  <---- THE VISUALRESULT OF P1'S SALVO 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

You hit a ship!                                  <---- MESSAGE DIPLAYED APPROPRIATE FOR THE HIT
Press Enter and pass the move to another player
```
Keep in mind that there will be a message displayed at the end of P2's play to indicate whehter the engine hit a ship or
missed. This will be clearly displayed for P1 to view as well. So after P2's shot you might see something like this 


```
The Intermediate-Adversary hit your ship at I4. Fire back!

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A ~ X ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~                  <---- P2's BATTLEFIELD (UNDER FOG OF WAR)
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

--------------------
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ O 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ O 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~                  <---- P1'S BATTLEFIED VISIBLE ON P1's TURN (WITH THE UPDATED HIT ON I4) 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
G O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I O O O X ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

Player 1, it's your turn:
A3
```

The game goes on until one players sinks all the ships of the other player. The appropriate celebratory message with 
the winning player's name is displayed and then the game stops.

#### Trapdoor
There is a trapdoor built in for the user. At any point of the game, if they choose to exit, they should type in `2187AA23`
and the program will terminate immediately.
