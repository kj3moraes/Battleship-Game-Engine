# Battleship-Game-Engine Guide
This is a PvE style Battleship game that allows the user to choose which Engine they want to go up against

## How to Play
This is a text-based game engine that is implemented in Java. The rules of the game are the same as the official 
version given by [Hasbro](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.pdf). For this game, the commands to play 
are as follows :

* Menu 1 
  * `start` - starts the **Human vs. Machine** match
  * `exit` - terminates the program
* Menu 2 (after `start`)
  * fk (TO BE COMPLETED)

## How-To-Play
This guides the reader on how to use the Battleship text-based game engine. This is a classic PvP match consisting of 2 parts - Setup and Wartime.

#### Setup
During setup, Player 1 is prompted first to place his/her ships on the battlefield. When prompted to do so a picture of the current battlefield arrangement will be shown and the user must type the first coordinate on the first line and the second coordinate on the second line.
* The Row letter must be followed by the Column number with no gaps between them
* After typing the first coordinates, press Enter and type the second coordinates.
* Only horizontal and vertical placements are legal

Remember to examine the length of the ship and the corresponding coordinates. _(You can't fit a Battleship (4 cells) in a space of 3 cells).
For example:

```
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A O O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 


Enter the coordinates of the Battleship (4 cells): 
D9
G9

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A O O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 


Enter the coordinates of the Submarine (3 cells): 

```

An approriate error message will be displayed if there is something wrong with the input. This occurs when :
* The specified coordinates are too small or too large for the ship
* The coordinates are invalid (eg. letters > J or numbers outside the 1 to 10 range)
* The ships are touching each other (only touching diagonally is legal).

Once Player 1 has completed setup, **double press the Enter key** and pass it one to Player 2 who must repeat the Setup proces.

#### Wartime
For Wartime, Player 1 wil go first. Player 1 will be shown Player 2's "Fog of War" screen at the top and they have to guess where they want to fire. Under P2 FOW is a divider and P1's own ship layout. P1 will guess where to fire and if they hit a ship they will see that part marked with the HIT character whether that be X or (any character that is designated by the programmer).

This is then followed by an enter prompt which generated as large amount of space and then Player 2 will play. **Now the obvious problem here is that if P2, scrolls enough then they will see P1s guess and ships, so one must trust the other to play fairly**. The following example denotes a possible scenario:

```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A X ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

--------------------
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A X O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ O 
B ~ M ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ O 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ O ~ O 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I O O O O ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

Player 2, it's your turn:
a2

  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
A X X ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
B ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
C ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
D ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
E ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
F ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
G ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
H ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
I ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
J ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

You hit a ship! 
Press Enter and pass the move to another player
```

The game goes on until one players sinks all the ships of the other player. The appropriate celebratory message with the winning player is displayed and then the game stops.

the comments in the code. A final PDF will be made detailing the algorithm implemented for Boogeyman and some aspects
of the code
